# Test-mode compose override for auth stack.
# Applied automatically by deploy_single_stack.yaml when _test_mode is true.
# Previously overrode POSTGRES_HOST and CROWDSEC_LAPI_URL to redirect production IPs
# to the local test VM. With the shared homelab Docker network, service names (postgres,
# crowdsec) resolve correctly on any host — no IP overrides needed.
# This file is kept as a no-op; add test-specific overrides here if needed.
