# Host definitions — managed machines that aren't Proxmox VMs.
# Cloud servers, physical hardware, legacy VMs, NAS boxes.
# Merged into host_roles / stack_roles derivations via vm_definitions.yaml.
# See vars/vm_definitions.yaml for the derivation formulas.
#
# Required fields:
#   vm_hostname    — FQDN for cloud-init/DNS. Use domain_ext for internet-facing
#                    hosts, vault_vm_search_domain for LAN hosts.
#                    host_roles automatically maps both domains for all hosts.
#   stacks         — ordered stack list (same as vm_definitions stacks key)

host_definitions:
  vps:
    vm_hostname: "vps.{{ domain_ext }}"
    stacks: [vpn]

  # Legacy hosts — remove after migration to core/apps/dev VMs is complete.
  tantiveiv:
    vm_hostname: "tantiveiv.{{ vault_vm_search_domain }}"
    stacks: [infra, databases, auth, monitoring, dev]
  odyssey:
    vm_hostname: "odyssey.{{ vault_vm_search_domain }}"
    stacks: [infra, apps, media]
